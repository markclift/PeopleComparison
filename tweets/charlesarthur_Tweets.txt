again, stenography isn't journalism. Discovering friction is. and while you were transcribing you could have put in the calls to MobileIron and Good Tech. Google briefing and publishing a blogpost about an already announced initiative is hard to see as "news". MobileIron, Good Technology could give you views. Then you'd have a better piece all around. it just happened to cross my radar. No personal agenda. What about: why hasn't Android got further into work? actually I'm also taking issue with the culture of unquestioning stenography. you're not allowed to ask to write a better piece than your assignment? To say "shouldn't this have some outside views?" book launched in 2012 and earned back advance many times, thanks. did I miss the part where you got the opinions of people *outside Google* on its plans? No, I didn't, as there aren't any. the worst kind. 1,000 words of blah. perceived security, perhaps. A rewrite of a corporate blogpost. Complete waste of time. No outside opinion, no extra detail. Genius Ant as Taylor Swift wins award at Brits: "Like to congratulate Kanye West for staying in his seat during that." very concentrated in gov and certain biz users - consumers abandoning at quite a rate. thanks - always interested to hear what things bug people. why? sounds like a result. Though have no idea how you'd notice. thanks, interesting, esp the watch stats. smart. ? how do you get it before it's published? ah, thought that would be the case. sounds interesting. (Though doesn't Amazon already get that on Kindle?) link? plan. Come up with a better data visualisation than the Bank of England. (Real comp, real data.) Reposting a CC-BY-licensed piece on my blog wouldn't be lazy if the piece is great, would it? hrm. There have been a lot of false summits. Steve Jones (the snail/genetics guy) would be the one to ask. Your call is very important to us. Please enjoy this 45 minute flute solo. it's more akin to discovering a PC and then opening it up and trying to understand the ICs while learning electronics. we can identify the genes. We just don't know quite how they work, and keep learning new stuff all the time. human ontogenesis is not susceptible to Moore's law. if you don't know the economics of adware, read up. cost of understanding genome: still unknown. extra for generic because there's nothing extra to yield margin. Dollars per install needed bcs consumer PCs almost zero margin. now decide how much extra consumers will pay for it in a market where price determines sales brutally. This is the best tweet ever: he's here again (though you've probably finished and moved on to Selling England by now). it's not the West. It's the US. yeah, occurred to me after I said it that biz users would have that. It's consumers who don't (or increasingly don't as BB7 dies). fascinating - thanks from all brands, or only Lenovo? Any Lenovo PC buyers come across something called "Pokki menu" preinstalled? true, except at that time it was getting SLA money. That's pretty much gone now, yes? @EdmondLococo still not sure I agree about that "holding steady". Let's await results in March. as I said elsewhere (and in the article), the question is whether it can have enough users to create viable handset demand. @EdmondLococo BB handsets sold in 2013: 18.2m (per IDC). In 2014: 6.4m. How is that "holding steady"? @SirSteven that's what the story says. Consumers going. üëçüëçüëç @SirSteven to..? when insanity is indistinguishable from really great trolling. @SirSteven strange it doesn't just do online sale. Guess that upsets carriers too much. @SirSteven yup. The problem I see is when the user base isn't large enough to drive viable handset replacement volume. "Blackberry is losing 56,000 users every month in the UK." wow‚Ä¶ how long until it's at zero?  (Guardia‚Ä¶ is market pressure on law firms simply due to excess supply of lawyers?

Love the Ofcom data. Morning On your question about UK domestic landlines... it's gone up! @GerritD picking a nit, but there's no evidence blackberry handset sales have stabilised. one of the first services to support Bitcoin, was seeing only 2 transactions a week at that rate it's about 15 months. big engineering companies with military/police connections tend to move cautiously. true. eMarketer press release should be on wires/ its site very soon if not already. from memory it's about that. fewer owners = fewer buyers for handsets = lower revenue = profit hard to find. Chen wants to sell 10m per year; 2014 = 5.8m By me: BlackBerry UK consumer users to dip below 1m, from 8m peak in mid-2012, as thousands per month go rounding error? Start up: should phones be thick?, toward 7nm, Volvo self-drives, S6 shortage?, Siri's successor Viv, and more didn't respond to me (it's outsourced to a PR agency). By me @ Guardian: BlackBerry left on the line as UK users continue to hang up It's on 50 Shades: @jandawson ah, so we're getting somewhere. Now you need to pick a sales number below which it's "disappointing". @BenedictEvans sure, but SSD storage was coming down the pike really fast. Replace HDD.

December 2014: "LoopPay plans additional security measures in the future, including the implementation of a process known as tokenisation." got a source on that? Because if LoopPay is just mag stripe details sent wirelessly then it's no safer than swiping a card, ie not at all. If LoopPay connects to mag stripe is it secure like NFC one-time codes (a la Apple Pay) or is it just mag stripe details sent wirelessly? but creates the fresh problem of "replace it with the model that just died or with something else with unknown flaws?" samsung is giving up on NFC for payments?

Don't pop them at parties, though. hmm I think that works for the advance-fee things (419 scams), but in these? OK, so that's settled then. (Even so, spinning hard drives? So 20th century.) As Jared said, it‚Äôs about friction - other gasses are heavier, so it‚Äôs like spinning the platters in soup. This "helium in disk drives" - why not use any noble gas? Also won't react, and much cheaper than helium. (Right?) less friction? I don't think there's significant friction with the air. Oxidation seems the likelier benefit. @mims I guess we haven't yet passed the Turing Test for smart homes. "We are sorry for the inconvenient." Do phishers assume that we assume that IT teams are illiterate? oh, ok. lol er, helium isn't explosive. It's super-inert. Is this "helium disk drive" stuff about less degradation? more reliable than filling them with a vacuum. it would be the cheaper option. But there's a nerd thing of "why not control it too?" Actually, Nest is closest to just being sensor. Use of helium-filled HDDs in data centers to drastically rise in 2015, says HGST president  helium-filled hard drives?

Cher W. @lisafleisher I rest my case, m'lud. @stuartdredge which has been a sore point with editors with exclusives for over 10 years now. @stuartdredge followed by Google News giving prominence to the *last* site to rewrite the piece, rather than the first. @saschasegan don't have one :-) but now, "exclusive: X" remains true only as long as it takes someone to write "X, says Y" no - but the point is that "exclusive" used to mean "nobody else has this", and print deadlines could make it true. maybe the way TV does it - BRAND NEW that would work for any site that never originated a thing but just leeched off others. "exclusive" has long been misappopriated, although it's true that it should carry the same meaning. do you agree with's views on UI? Interested to hear your take on this. These days rather than "EXCLUSIVE" news orgs should tout work as "ORIGINAL". That would show who's just churning. Which is kind of apposite. Interview: Jony Ive profile in New Yorker must have involved dozens of interviews with many people over months. But all that work effectively hidden. it's totally puzzling.

It's desktop/mobile detection. In Safari, if I choose user-agent as "iPhone" I get the video. If I choose Safari 8.0.3 (desktop) I get "install Flash". that doesn't explain why it works fine on mobile. some stuff I want to view is on FB. puzzled. I've disabled Flash in the browser, and it's not offering any alternative. this machine can surely run H.264 HTML5 - it's Chrome, on a Mac. And FB can serve it to mobile. fine, but I'm viewing in Chrome. Are they starting from lowest common denominator? Why does Facebook video on desktop *require* Flash?
